##### Introduction

This project was completed as part of Google Summer of Code 2019 under the mentorship of RedHen Lab. I'd like to thank Prof Dr TM
Thasleema, Central University Kerala and Karan Singla, PhD graduate student at USC Viterbi school of Engineering.

The scope of this project is to build a generic high accuracy Speech Recognition engine using Deep Learning for English news and 
specifically Indian English news.
