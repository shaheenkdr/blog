The year 2018 was fabulous altogether. It got an even exhilarating finish, as FAIR (Facebook AI Research Team) by surprise released their end-to-end deep learning toolkit for Speech recognition.

According to FAIR, Wav2letter follows a completely convolutional approach, and uses Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) for acoustic modelling as well as language modelling. Whatâ€™s even more interesting here is, beginning from the Waveform to the end word transcription, the architecture of Wav2letter is composed only of convolutional layers. In a domain where recurrent architectures are more prevalent, this is quite exciting to see CNNs producing results that are competitive with recurrent architectures.

Also, to help everyone get a concise & precise overview of how Wav2letter works, the FAIR team has also made the architecture of Wav2letter public:
