##### Introduction

This project was completed as part of [Google Summer of Code 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6492594211651584) under the mentorship of RedHen Lab. I'd like to thank Prof Dr TM
Thasleema, Central University Kerala and Karan Singla, PhD graduate student at USC Viterbi school of Engineering mentors of this project for their extended and comprehensive support without which this project wouldn't have been completed. Also absolutely indebted to Prof Mark Turner, Case Western Reserve University, and Prof Francis Steen UCLA, for exceptional and quick support from the community side.

The scope of this project is to build a Hindi Speech Recognition Engine to transcribe news. However the lack of adequate datasets made this a really challenging task to complete. Hence this project is completed with a pre-recorded 150 sentences in Hindi spoken by 6 speakers. 


##### Languages & Frameworks

This project was completely developed in the Kaldi Toolkit, and was run, tested and deployed in a Linux Ubuntu variant OS. The languages used include : 

* Shell

* C 

* Perl

* Python

* Cpp


##### Development

The initial task is to properly curate the data. The initial raw text is in devanagari script, which is then converted to ILSL12 convention (which is used by Indian speech R&D community). This was done by first converting Indian-language text from UTF-8 Unicode Devanagari to ISCII format and then from ISCII to ILSL12 convention. Followed by which the data is prepared as per the Kaldi format, which includes the general files wav.scp, utt2spk, spk2utt, text etc .

. The next task is to do feature extraction (MFCC) from the dataset.
In order to do so :
